# picpay-announcements-backend

Welcome to the picpay-announcements-backend backend plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn
start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/picpay-announcements-backend](http://localhost:3000/picpay-announcements-backend).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](/dev) directory.
