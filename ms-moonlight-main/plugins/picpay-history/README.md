# picpay-history

Welcome to the picpay-history plugin!

The History plugin will record the tasks of deleting or renaming services, through Component Management, with quick access through the side menu.

It is to do research and analysis on the table according to the service owner, request status, and also the general progress status. And it also has direct redirection to the Component Management screen.

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/picpay-history](http://localhost:3000/history).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
