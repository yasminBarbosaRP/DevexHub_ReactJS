# picpay-pipeline-run

Welcome to the picpay-pipeline-run plugin!

The Pipeline plugin registers the stage and status of pipelines from the last 60 minutes, with direct access to the specific component.

It is possible to carry out research and analysis, according to the Pipeline stage and its current Status. And it even has a direct redirection to the detailed logs.

You can also open an explanatory Tutorial Modal.

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/picpay-pipeline-run](http://localhost:3000/picpay-pipeline-run).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
